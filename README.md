# Trillionaires of College Basketball

The "trillion" is the most irrelevant statistic in all of basketball. This is due to just that, the metric measures the irrelevance of a basketball player.  

How does one achieve a trillion? Imagine a walk-on at the end of a blow-out college basketball game:

- He checks in during the final minute

- Fails to record a single stat during the game (no points, rebounds, assists, turnovers, etc.)

  - *This* would be a **one**-trillion (a one in the first column of the box score, followed by 12*ish* zeros) 
  
  - If he had played two minutes, it would be a two trillion... and so on.

On this site, we will explore the most irrelevant bench-warmers in college basketball since the 2010-2011 season (when box-scores became available on [Sports Reference](http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/)).  Join me in giving some undeserved attention to these players. 

## Who totaled the most minutes in their Trillion games?

It looks like Phillip Johnson from Incarnate Word is the head of the trillion club... or is he?

According to the father of the trillion,[the trillion ['loses its value'](http://clubtrillion.blogspot.com/2009/12/abhor-more-than-four.html?m=0) beyond 4 minutes of action.  So, let's look at how these same players compare in terms of number of trillions recorded, and color each one by it's number of minutes:
