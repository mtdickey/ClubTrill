# ClubTrill
Motivated by Mark Titus, this scraper and analysis investigates who is the greatest "Trillionaire" of NCAA and NBA basketball. 

The "trillion" is the most irrelevant statistic in all of basketball. This is due to just that, the metric measures the irrelevance of a basketball player.  

Imagine a walk-on at the end of a blow-out NCAA basketball game: he checks in during the final minute, but fails to record a single other stat during the game (no points, rebounds, assists, turnovers, etc.). This would be a one-trillion (a one in the first column of the box score, followed by 12 zeros).  If he had played two minutes, it would be a two trillion.

In this repository, we will explore who the most irrelevant bench-warmers have been in college basketball since the 2010-2011 season (when box-scores became available on [Sports Reference](http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/)).  Join me in shining a light and giving some undeserved attention to these players.
