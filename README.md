# Trillionaires of College Basketball

The "trillion" is the most irrelevant statistic in all of basketball. This is due to just that, the metric measures the irrelevance of a basketball player.  

How does one achieve a trillion? Imagine a walk-on at the end of a blow-out college basketball game:

- He checks in during the final minute

- Fails to record a single stat during the game (no points, rebounds, assists, turnovers, etc.)

  - *This* would be a **one**-trillion (a one in the first column of the box score, followed by 12*ish* zeros) 
  
  - If he had played two minutes, it would be a two trillion... and so on.

On this site, we will explore the most irrelevant bench-warmers in college basketball since the 2010-2011 season (when box-scores became available on [Sports Reference](http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/)).  Join me in giving some undeserved attention to these players.
